WebAssembly: Irreducible control flow rewrite

  Rewrite WebAssemblyFixIrreducibleControlFlow to a simpler and cleaner design,
  which directly computes reachability and other properties itself instead of
  using LLVM loop info, which we had to update or throw out, and was the cause
  of complexity and bugs. (The new graph analyses are very similar to how the
  Relooper algorithm would find loop entries and so forth.)

  This fixes a few bugs, including where we had a false positive and thought
  fannkuch was irreducible when it was not, which made us much larger and
  slower there, and a reverse bug where we missed irreducibility.
