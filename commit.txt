Irreducible control flow is not that rare, e.g. it happens in malloc and 3
other places in the libc portions linked in to a hello world program. This
patch improves how we handle that code: it emits a br_table to dispatch to only
the minimal necessary number of blocks. This reduces the size of malloc by 33%,
and makes it comparable in size to asm2wasm's malloc output.
